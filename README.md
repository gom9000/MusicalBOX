# musicalBOX

![musicalbox.jpg](images/musicalbox.jpg)

This is a home didactic project for a *cheap magic musical box* that help me to play on-stage Genesis cover with my [band](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nurserycrymeband).  

Basically is a customized version of [Joseph Ernest's SamplerBox](https://github.com/josephernest/SamplerBox/) with a lighted switch-matrix panel for preset change, and in/out line routing.
